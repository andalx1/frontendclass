    <p>This week I studied the topics included in the instructions given. Css transforms and transition are two very good tools very useful to make our designs more eye-catching.  </p>
    <p>There are some deails related to json that i do not understand well but I like the idea of using some website to improve our sites and i also like the idea of sharing information from one site to other. It is a sign of help and desire to share our knowledge with the purpose of progressing.</p>
